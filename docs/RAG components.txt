Ingest — runners that accept PDFs, DOCX, TXT, images (OCR), and metadata.

Preprocess & chunk — extract text, normalize, split into chunks with overlap, attach provenance metadata.

Embed & store — call text-embedding-3-large to embed each chunk; upsert into Chroma collection with metadata.

Retrieve — on query, embed query, perform top-K ANN search in Chroma, return ranked chunks + provenance.

RAG generation — feed retrieved chunks into an LLM (GPT-4o/GPT-4.1) via a carefully constructed prompt that enforces grounding and structured output.

Post-process — validate LLM response with Pydantic schema; sanitize outputs; log evidence; optionally re-run if schema fails or hallucination detected.

Guardrails & monitoring — content filters, rate limits, relevance thresholds, explainability, human-in-the-loop for high-risk responses.

CI/CD & infra — automated tests, containerized services, DB backups, vector pruning/retention policy, metrics & alerting.
